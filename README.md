# Distributed Ticket Management System

## Overview
This is a distributed system project designed to manage tickets using Java. It demonstrates the integration of UDP and AMQP communication protocols with a modular architecture. The project is part of my coursework on Distributed Systems.

## Features
- **Backend Communication**: Uses RabbitMQ (AMQP) and UDP for ticket management.
- **Local and Remote Backends**: Supports in-memory and remote backend implementations.
- **Ticket Operations**: Create, update, and manage tickets.
- **Java-Based**: Built with Gradle for dependency management and builds.

## Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
- **Messaging Protocols**: AMQP (via RabbitMQ), UDP
- **Other Tools**: Git, IntelliJ IDEA

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Distributed-Ticket-Management-System.git
   cd Distributed-Ticket-Management-System
